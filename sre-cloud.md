# S.R.E / Cloud Challenge

## About the Challenge... 

We have two challenges, the first one is an intermediate test, and the second is a more advanced: The both challenges is about defining an architecture for Zé at AWS, considering several requirements that are necessary to consider.

Feel free to ask any question - we really want you to succeed and then, join us to help evolve our platform.

## The First Challenge - Intermediate

### Specifications: 

- An nginx presenting a static web page
- Allow this application to be publicly accessible
- Apply as best practices thinking about security, high availability, failure and costs
- Develop automation with your preferred tool to allow:
- Deploy the new version of the web application without downtime
- Rollback to previous version when needed
- Write an adorably good readme, explaining how your solution was designed and how to deploy it


### General Guidance

Should you have any questions or regards about the test, do not hesitate do ask us.

### How to deliver it

Please, use Github to host your code and add @ze-engineering-code-challenge as a collaborator for it. This Github account (@ze-engineering-code-challenge) is solely used by Zé's engineers to download your code and review it.

**Once you have finished the challenge, please submit your information on this amazing form:**

## The Second Challenge - Advanced

### The Story

Imagine we are starting to build the very first version of Zé Delivery platform, considering:

- Zé Delivery Consumer App: the one available at the app stores and where an user has an account and submit the orders 
- Zé Delivery Consumer Web: practically equal to the app in functionalities, and used directly in browsers
- Zé Entregador App: used by couriers that will receive information from the orders that they have to deliver
- Zé Partner: web app used by our distributors to manage orders and define their portfolio

### Building the Platform

In a fresh AWS cloud account, how would you draw and develop the Zé's infrastructure, considering all the services we want to develop? Think about security, network, communication, databases, etc. While drawing, we also need you to think about requirements like high-availability, performance and even how to give access to our development team to the production database.: 

We expect a high-level infrastrutucture drawing and explanations about each part of it - you can be as pragmatic as possible, the objective here is to quickly understand what you are proposing.

### Technical Requirements

We need you to propose the infrastructure with AWS in your mind - at Zé's, our entire platform runs on AWS.

### Writing it down (IaC)

After drawing the proposed infrastrucure, we would like you to write it down using some tool like CloudFormation, Terraform or any other that you feel confortable in using it (at Zé, we have our infrastructure codified using both tools).

### How to deliver it

Please, create a repo in Github to host the resource presenting the infrastructure and also the code to implement it. For the drawing, feel free to use any kind of tool to generate it - it can be a PDF, a presentation, or anything else - we are just interested in the content.

Don't forget to add @ze-engineering-code-challenge as a collaborator for it. This Github account (@ze-engineering-code-challenge) is solely used by Zé's engineers to download your code and review it.
