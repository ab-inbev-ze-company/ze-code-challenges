# QA Challenge

## About the challenge


We don't want our customers to have problems and bugs while using our platform, Zé Delivery. Specially in this super important moment, which is when he chooses a cold beer to enjoy it right away.

Well, having that in mind, we must implement a few tests to minimize this risk:


### 1. Identify critical flows

You'll notice that our web and mobile platforms are a bit different, so for this first part of the code challenge, you can choose one of the 3 applications we have: **Android, iOS, Web**.

i. Identify **3 important flows** that keep the application working properly.
e.g.: Login (Login is an important flow because the user needs to be logged in in order to finish a purchase)

ii. Provide a detailed explanation of why these flows are important so the user can purchase his products

Hint:
**Choosing the most critical flows and detailing them as much as possible will give you higher scores in this part**


### 2. UI automation test

i. In this step, you'll have to create one automation test suite. A web test automation or an app test automation:
##### Web automated test
In our [Web application](https://www.ze.delivery/) create an automation test suite to a scenario from the code challenge part 1 (choose one of the 3 flows you created in `1. Identify critical flows`).

##### Mobile automated test
In our Mobile application, choose one of the apps [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cerveceriamodelo.modelonow&hl=pt_BR) or [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/br/app/z%C3%A9-delivery/id1070070438).
Create an automation test suite to a scenario from the code challenge part 1 (choose one of the 3 flows you created in `1. Identify critical flows`).

ii. Please provide a summary with guidelines of the decisions you made (e.g Explain why you chose such programming language, framework etc).

**Please provide a detailed read.me file with clear instructions on how to setup the environment and run the tests in our local machines!**

Hint:
**Choosing the most critical flow to keep the application working properly will give you higher scores!**

### 3. API automation test

We're looking for an automation test suite for an open API with **ATDD approach**

Create automated tests to get weather using Open Weather API
[http://openweathermap.org/current](http://openweathermap.org/current)

Hint:
**Covering more scenarios and being flexible to different types of responses will give you higher scores** 

## Final considerations

To create the tests above, you can choose any programming language, framework etc you feel more comfortable.

**Don't forget to provide a detailed documentation on how to install and run the tests**

This test will be evaluated by Zé Delivery Engineering team.

If you're having any issues with the challenge, feel free to contact us.
Good Luck!
