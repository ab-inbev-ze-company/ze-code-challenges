# Data Science Technical Case

## About the Case.
*... It's not just a Kaggle competition!* 

To evaluate the technical skills of our Data Science candidates, we kindly ask you to solve the challenge in the link below. This is a demand forecasting problem where you must build a model able to forecast weekly sales for different departments, stores, and retailers.

## Here are some instructions (and tips!) for your solution:
* Your resolution must be developed and delivered on a **[Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/notebooks);**
* Please, build your solution in an organized and structured way, because we want to understand what steps you took to develop your model;
* We also expect to read a text containing your solution justifying the decisions made and highlighting the main conclusions (example: why you decided to plot a graph, explain what conclusions you can extract from it; or why you are choosing a particular model, make it clear which was the criterion for choice). It's super important that our team can follow your way of thinking without following the lines of code!
* Code quality is also very important, so keep in mind that well-written code warms our hearts!
* **Super tip:** a clear and well-structured rationale is more important than a model with very high performance! Also, we often need to explain our reasoning to a non-technical audience, so it's worth exercising your ability to explain complex concepts simply!

## About delivering the Case
**Once you finish the challenge, please follow the instructions on this [form](https://forms.gle/bvzPLLdbre4yr9k19).**

**Important!**
* Remember to make your Kaggle notebook public so we can access it;
* Be aware to present your solution if called for a technical interview!

**Good luck and have fun,**
